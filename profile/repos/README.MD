is going to be our **new** website filled with content, project pages and most importantly easter eggs! (We love easter eggs!) But thats not all! We are also going to be adding a **Bio** to our website, so you can get to know us a little better! We also have forums if you want to check it out. Currently it is using phpBB and is getting some much needed attention! Were also thinking of making a Discord for you guys to hang out and have fun! Follow out **[Twitter]** to stay tuned and for more updates!
